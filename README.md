# Churn Prediction MLOps Project

This repository contains the Churn Prediction notebook and dataset for a data engineering / MLOps project.

## Project Structure
- Churn_Prediction_MLOps_Final.ipynb — main Jupyter notebook with data exploration, modeling, and evaluation.
- data_tp_churn.csv — dataset used by the notebook.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter (notebook or lab)
- Common Python packages used: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

Install typical dependencies with:

```bash
pip install jupyter pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Open the notebook: `Churn_Prediction_MLOps_Final.ipynb`.
2. Ensure `data_tp_churn.csv` is in the same folder as the notebook.
3. Start Jupyter and run the cells in order:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Notes
- This README is intentionally concise. If you want, I can add a requirements.txt, a short summary of the model and results, or usage examples for training/evaluation scripts.
